Email Validator---------------
In Angular 2, you used the regular expression within the pattern attribute of input for email validation. Now, from version 4, email validator is added to make your life simple.

Angular 2
<input type="email" name="email" pattern="^\w+([\.-]?\w+)*@\w+([\.-]?\w+)*(\.\w{2,3})+$">

Angular 4 and above
<input type="email" name="email" email>

New CLIs-------------------------

From Angular v6, the following new CLIs are added:

ng add: to add new functionalities to your app

ng update: to update your app from older to newer angular version

ng generate library: to generate an angular library

Angular Update Guide--------------
Angular update guide, added in Angular v6, is the new feature which lets you update angular apps from older to a newer version with less hassle.

If your current angular app version is 4, it is recommended you first upgrade it to 5, and then to version 6.

CLI to Update Package--------------------
ng update is the new CLI command used to update the angular packages inside your project.

Syntax: ng update <package name>

For example ng update @angular/core


Add New Features--------------------
You can add new features or capabilities to your angular project, such as PWA, material design, by using ng add CLI command.

Syntax: ng add <package name>

For example, your current project does not have a material design. You can add the angular material design feature using ng add @angular/material

Did you wonder what could be the difference between ng add @angular/material and npm install @angular/material?


Ivy Renderer---------------------------------------------------------
Ivy is the new rendering engine from the Angular team.
Wait, what is a rendering engine?
Whatever you write in component class and template is translated by Angular's rendering
 engine into usual HTML and JavaScript, so your browser can read and display.

This might not change the way you code but improves the build time and bundle size of your app.

Enable Ivy
Note: Ivy is still in the development phase. If you want to give it a try, you can enable the following settings in tsconfig.json file.

"angularCompilerOptions": {
  "enableIvy": true
}

Angular Elements-----------------------
Now you can define your own custom HTML element like <my-element> using Angular Elements,
which can be used by apps developed on any different framework. `
In terms of angular, it is an angular component packaged as a custom element.

Example: <my-popup message="Use Angular!"></my-popup>

Angular Elements
Angular Elements can be built using createCustomElement() API available in @angular/elements package.
 The function transforms the component along with its dependencies, to your custom element.

The developer using your custom element to build a (for example React) web app, need not know about Angular or
 the implementation within the component.

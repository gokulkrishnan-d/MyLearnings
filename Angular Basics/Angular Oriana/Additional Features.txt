If your current angular app version is 4, it is recommended you first upgrade it to 5, and then to version 6.

CLI to Update Package--------------------
ng update is the new CLI command used to update the angular packages inside your project.

Syntax: ng update <package name>

For example ng update @angular/core


Add New Features--------------------
You can add new features or capabilities to your angular project, such as PWA, material design, by using ng add CLI command.

Syntax: ng add <package name>

For example, your current project does not have a material design. You can add the angular material design feature using ng add @angular/material

Did you wonder what could be the difference between ng add @angular/material and npm install @angular/material?

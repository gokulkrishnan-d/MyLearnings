What are Directives?
Directive is a class with @Directive decorator. They make DOM elements dynamic, by changing their behavior.

Directive is of three types: Structural, Attribute and Component.

Structural Directive
They manipulate the DOM elements. i.e. Delete or update the elements. This changes the structure of webpage.

Some of the built-in structural directives, Angular 2 offers are NgIf, NgFor and NgSwitch.

Example: <div *ngIf="employee">{{employee.name}}</div>


Attribute Directive
These directives add styling by manipulating the Attributes of DOM element. They do not change the structure of webpage.

NgStyle and NgClass are some of the built-in attribute directives, Angular 2 provides.

Custom Directive
We can also create custom attribute directives using @Directive decorator. This video will show you how to create custom directive.

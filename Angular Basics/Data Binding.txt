It is the process of automatic synchronization of view and business logic. It helps in connecting the Template (view - what user sees) with Component (back end data/source).

There are four ways you can bind a data to the DOM depending on the direction the data flows.

Data flows into the view by Interpolation and Property Binding.
Data flows outside the view into the class by Event Binding.
Data flows both ways by Two-Way Data Binding.

Interpolation
Interpolation acts as local variable, which allows us to bind data from "Component Class" onto your "Template".

It is defined using {{ }} double curly braces.
If we consider an example, 20 + 20 results in {{20 + 20}}, the actual mathematical calculation is done and output is displayed as 20 + 20 results in 40.
It can also access values from component class. Ex - {{myName}}
It can further assign attributes to the tags. Ex - <img src = {{myImageURL}}>

Property Binding
Data flows from "Component Class' Property" to "Template".
It is defined using [] square brackets. The following video will explain Property Binding in detail.

Property Binding vs Interpolation
Both are same, as they make the data flow from "Component" to "Template". The only difference is the way they are defined or used.

Interpolation Demo
    import { component } from `@angular2/core`;
    @Component ({
        selector: 'myApp',
        template: `
          <h1> {{title}} </h1>  //Interpolation Binding  `
    })
    export class AppComponent {
        title: "Hello Fresco !"
    }
Property Binding Demo
    import { component } from `@angular2/core`;
    @Component ({
        selector: 'myApp',
        template: `
          <h1  [innerHtml] = "title"> </h1>  //Property Binding
        `
    })
    export class AppComponent {
        title: "Hello Fresco !"
    }



    Event Binding
    User interaction on view generates "Events" that make data flow from "Template" to "Component".
    It is defined using () paranthesis. The following video will explain Event Binding in detail.

    Two-Way Data Binding
    Property Binding and Event Binding are One Way Data Binding.
    In other words, data will flow either from Component to View or the other way, but not both.

    Two-way data binding is a combination of both Property Binding and Event Binding allowing us to update data in both directions.
     It is defined using [( )] popularly known as banana brackets.

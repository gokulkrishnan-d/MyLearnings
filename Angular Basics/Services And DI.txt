What is Service?
Services are functions that are designed to complete a specific task.
 If you want to bring external data from server into your app or perform some repetitive task, then services come handy.

 How to use Services?

 Create a file <serviceName>.services.ts.
 Import injectable from @angular/core.
 Create a class with the required function and use the decorator @injectable() to specify that it is a service.
 Then import the service in root component, which is discussed in Dependency Injection.
 Example: This simple service will perform add operation whenever it is used.

     import {Injectable} from 'angular2/core';

     @Injectable()
     export class MyService {
         addFunction(a,b){ return a+b; }
     }




What is Dependency Injection?

Dependency Injection is a way to "Inject" the parameters or services (dependencies),
 on which the new Instance is "Dependent" for its creation. How the dependencies are created is not a point of concern
 for the instance consuming the dependency.

Angular finds which services are required to the component, by looking at the "type" of component's constructor parameters.
Angular then checks for the service in Injector, which makes a container of all services that have already been created.

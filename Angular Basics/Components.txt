What is Component?
A component is the basic block of angular 2 app.
It handles the view part of the app and has the core logic of the page.
It can render the view by itself based on the dependency Injection.
There can be only one component per DOM element (i.e. only one selector element).
Element's behavior can be manipulated by the properties associated with corresponding component.
It can be identified using the decorator @Component.
Components can be created, updated or destroyed based on the user actions on the page.


Components - Example
This example will render Hello, World! in the browser. Angular will search for <my-app>
element in HTML file and replace it with the template content.

File: app.component.ts
 import { Component } from '@angular/core';
 @Component({
  selector: 'my-app',
  template: '<p>Hello, World!</p>',
 })
 export class AppComponent{}

File: index.html
 ............
 <body>
  <my-app> Loading... </my-app>
 </body>
 ............

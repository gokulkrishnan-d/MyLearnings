What is Metadata?
In Angular 2, Metadata is vital in getting the code processed and shown on the screen. Metadata means data of data, which gives more info about data.

 ex: var age : number = 20;
 // 20 is data
 // "number" is metadata, as it tells information of "data", its type, its size etc.

 Metadata - Example
 Let us consider a simple example code as shown below. Suppose you want to have a component,
 Angular will consider it as a simple "class" until you explicitly use "Decorator" and attach metadata to TypeScript.

 Here, @Component is used to define a class as component.

 Likewise, @pipe is used to tell Angular to define a class as pipe.

  import {Component} from 'angular2/core';
  @Component({  //METADATA
     selector: 'greet',
     template: `
          <h1>Hello There!!!</h1>
          <h2>Have a nice day.</h2>    `
  })
  export class GreetApp {}
 Simply put, everything in Angular 2 is a simple class, until you declare metadata (@Component or @Pipe or @Decorator or @Injectable) to it.

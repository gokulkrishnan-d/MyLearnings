What is Module?
A Module is a way of organizing related Components, Services, Directives, and Pipes with a specific functionality.

It is a block of code meant to do certain tasks.

There can be several Modules within an app, but it should consist of at least one root module. Root Module, by convention,
must be named: AppModule.

It can be exported and imported in other modules.

@NgModule is used to declare a Class as Module.

Module as library - Angular Module can act as a library of modules. @angular/core is a most common library being
used in building angular application. It has most of the modules that are required for your app.

Module - Example
This is a sample code for module.

 import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
 import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';
 @NgModule({
  imports: [BrowserModule],
  declarations: [AppComponent],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent]
 })
 export class AppModule { }
 // AppModule Class is now defined as Module : @NgModule
Trick to identify Root Module is that it imports "BrowserModule". Other modules of that same application imports "CommonModule".
imports:[...] - define array of modules required to build application here.
declarations:[...] - define components, directives and pipes for this module here.
bootstrap:[...] - define root component of this module here.

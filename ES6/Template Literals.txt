Template string makes it easy to create strings that are longer and have lot of dynamic content (variables)
 with exact amount of spaces, line breaks and indentation.

 -Instead of single quotes or double quotes, ES6 uses BACKTICK or OPENQUOTE ( " ` " )

 ex:::

 Creating a multiline string in     JS:

let bio = "Wendy Harper /n Software Engineer - TCS /n 3 Years in Web development"
Creating the same in ES6

let bio = `Wendy Harper
           Software Engineer - TCS
           3 Years in Web development`


           ================================
The literal is delimited by backticks and the interpolated expressions inside the literal are delimited by ${ variable }.

ex:
let person = {
    fN: `Wendy`,
    lN: `Harper`,
    name: function() {
        return `My name is ${this.fN} ${this.lN}`;
    }
};

let a =10;
let b =19;

console.log(`The result is ${a+b}`);
person.name();

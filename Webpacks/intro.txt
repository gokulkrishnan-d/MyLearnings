What is Webpack?

Webpack is an open source module bundler for modern JavaScript applications.

 It takes modules with dependencies and generates static assets representing those modules.

 When do you need Webpack?

Webpack is good fit for a complex front-end application with non-code static assets like style sheets, images etc.

Webpack is not recommended for small web applications.

Why do you need Webpack?

Based on the dependency, Webpack creates a dependency graph so as to give a modular approach to the web applications.

Code Splitting (detailed later in the course) is an exciting feature that keeps Webpack distinct from all other module bundlers.


Goals of Webpack

Spliting the dependency tree into chunks loaded on demand
Reducing initial load time
Every static asset should be able to be a module
Integrating Third party libraries as modules
Ensuring each part of the module is customizable
Webpack is very much suitable for large projects

It can compile one js to another...
It used for minification of js/css,inline css, compile sass , compile es6 etc

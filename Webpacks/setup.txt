mkdir wepack_demo

cd wepack_demo

npm init to create a package.json

npm install webpack -g

npm i webpack-cli -g

u can add config file for the webpack which used to run webpack in cmd 
and by adding watch: true in config , it will always check for the change and compile automatically

And cmd "webpack -p " which run the webpack in prod mode will minify the js to smaller size

SASS Variables
SASS variables are used to store information.

Variables are defined with a dollar sign ($ ) followed by a variable name


$color: red;

Variable Interpolation|***********

Variables can be used anywhere in the SASS file.

They can be used (interpolated) in class, property or inside string of a plain text.

Example:

SCSS file


$car: Benz;

$speed: averagespeed;



.#{$car}

{

  #{$speed}:336km/h;

}

CSS file


.Benz {

  averagespeed: 336km/h; }


  SASS Script*****************************

  Sass script enables you to compute CSS selector, property or value using Sass expression.

  A Sass expression is the combination of values and operators.

  Sass transpiler will evaluate the sass expression before producing the CSS output.

  Example:

  SCSS file


  $car: Benz;

  p

  {

        car-name: $car;

  }


SASS Interpreter******************

You can also evaluate Sass expression using an interpreter instead of using Sass transpiler.

Install interpreter in your system by executing:


sass -i

After successful installation, the command prompt will prompt you with the symbol “>>” indicating that the interpreter is up and running.

Type in the expression and the result will be displayed on the terminal. You can use variables as well,
 but remember that the variable values will not be retained when you close the terminal.

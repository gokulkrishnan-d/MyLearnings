Introduction to SASS

Syntactically Awesome Style Sheet or simply called as SASS is a CSS preprocessor.

It enables you to create style sheets faster.

Extends the functionality of CSS by allowing you to use variables, nested rules, functions, and mixins.

SASS is written in Ruby language

LESS, Stylus and PostCSS are few other popular CSS preprocessors.

Features of SASS
Sass is more stable, powerful and compatible with all versions of CSS.

It is an open source preprocessor.

It has its own syntax, which compiles to readable CSS. Hence you can write CSS easily (less code in less time).


Install SASS:

npm install -g sass

The most direct way to make this happen is in your terminal. Once Sass is installed,
 you can compile your Sass to CSS using the sass command. You'll need to tell Sass which file to build from, and where to output CSS to.
 For example, running sass input.scss output.css from your terminal would take a single Sass file,
  input.scss, and compile that file to output.css.

You can also watch individual files or directories with the --watch flag.
The watch flag tells Sass to watch your source files for changes, and re-compile CSS each time you save your Sass.
If you wanted to watch (instead of manually build) your input.scss file, you'd just add the watch flag to your command, like so:

sass styles.scss styles.css

sass --watch input.scss output.css

You can watch and output to directories by using folder paths as your input and output, and separating them with a colon. In this example:

sass --watch app/sass:public/stylesheets

Convert from SASS to SCSS-------------------------------

sass-convert styles.sass styles.scss


Syntax of SASS************************************
You are now equipped with the knowledge to install SASS, you will now move on to the programming part.

You must know that SASS supports two types of syntax:

SASS Syntax

SCSS Syntax

SASS Syntax
It uses indentation to identify code blocks and newline to separate lines within a block. These files are saved with the .sass extension.

Sample:


     .new

     color:#ff0055

     font-weight:bold

     span

     text-transform:uppercase


 SCSS syntax***************
 An extension of CSS syntax is SCSS (Sassy syntax).

 It uses braces to identify code blocks and semicolons to separate lines within a block. These files are saved with the .scss extension.

 Sample:


 .new {

        color:#00ff55;

        font-weight:bold;

       }

 span {

        text-transform:uppercase;

       }
